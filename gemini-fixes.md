# Gemini Code Fixes

This file documents the logic issues and errors found and fixed by Gemini.

## `app/Http/Controllers/Products/ProductsController.php`

- **`export` method:** The `$request` variable was being used without being passed as an argument. This has been fixed by adding `Request $request` to the method signature.
- **`store` and `update` methods:** The `validated()` method was being called without assigning the result to a variable. This has been fixed by assigning the result of `$request->validated()` to a `$data` variable and using that variable to create and update the product.
- **`update` method:** The `update` method was not handling image updates. A new `updateImage` method has been added to handle image updates, and the `update` method has been modified to use this new method.

## `app/Http/Requests/Products/ProductsRequest.php`

- **`rules` method:** The `image` field was not being validated. The appropriate validation rules have been added to the `rules` method to ensure that the uploaded file is an image and does not exceed a certain size.

## `app/Http/Controllers/Sales/SalesController.php`

- **`update` method:** The `order_total_amount` was not being updated in the database. This has been fixed by changing `total_amount` to `order_total_amount` in the `update` method.
- **`destroy` method:** The `stock_id` was not being retrieved from the order. This has been fixed by changing `$product->pivot->stock_id` to `$order->stock_id` in the `destroy` method.

## `app/Http/Requests/OrderRequest.php`

- **`rules` method:** The `order_total_amount` field was not being validated. The appropriate validation rules have been added to the `rules` method to ensure that the `order_total_amount` is a numeric value and is not negative.
